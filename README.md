## 1- Linear Regression algorithm
Linear Regression is a supervised ML algorithm that aims to find the line (in case of 2D) that best fits a set 2D scattered points. The model can be extended to a higher dimension, in this case we try to find the hyperplane that best approximate the scattered points. If the dimension of data (point) is N then the hyperplane dimension is (N-1).
The code presented in linear_regression2D.py uses the Gradient Descent optimization method to find the values of the coefficients b and m that define the line that best approximate the data included in the 'data.csv' file. The equation of that line is defined as follows:
                                                           Y = m*X + b
